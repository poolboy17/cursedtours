          Charleston, founded in 1670 as Charles Town, earned the nickname "Holy City" for its religious tolerance and abundance of church steeples. But beneath its gracious antebellum facades lies a darker history: Charleston served as the primary port of entry for enslaved Africans brought to North America. An estimated 40% of all enslaved people who entered what is now the United States passed through Charleston Harbor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city endured siege during the Revolutionary War, bombardment during the Civil War, a devastating earthquake in 1886, and hurricanes too numerous to count. Yellow fever epidemics struck repeatedly throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Pirates were hanged at White Point Garden, their bodies left on display as warnings to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charleston's ghost stories reflect this layered history. Tours navigate between sites associated with the domestic slave trade, battlefields from two wars, plague victims, executed pirates, and the city's notorious jail that held prisoners for 137 years.

        <p>
          Gadsden's Wharf, now a park near the South Carolina Aquarium, processed enslaved Africans for sale to plantations throughout the South. The Sullivan's Island pest houses, where arriving ships quarantined before unloading their human cargo, saw death on a scale that earned the island the nickname "the Ellis Island of Black America"—though with far different implications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Charleston Earthquake of 1886 killed over 100 people and damaged 2,000 buildings. It remains the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the southeastern United States. The city rebuilt, incorporating visible "earthquake bolts" that still mark buildings throughout the peninsula.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Old City Jail operated from 1802 to 1939, housing everyone from Civil War prisoners to common criminals to Denmark Vesey, executed for planning a slave rebellion in 1822. Lavinia Fisher, often called America's first female serial killer, was hanged after operating out of the Six Mile Wayfarer House. The jail's conditions were notoriously brutal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fort Sumter, where the Civil War began in April 1861, sits in Charleston Harbor. The city endured the longest siege in American military history—587 days of Union bombardment that reduced much of downtown to rubble. Thousands died within the city walls.

          Walking tours through the Historic District pass Charleston's most documented haunted locations. The Dock Street Theatre, built on the site of a hotel where a working woman named Nettie reportedly fell to her death, claims multiple active spirits including actors from centuries of theatrical productions.

          The Unitarian Church cemetery on Archdale Street contains graves dating to 1772 and reports of apparitions among its crumbling stones. Edgar Allan Poe was stationed at nearby Fort Moultrie in 1827, and his experience in Charleston influenced "The Gold-Bug."

          Magnolia Cemetery, opened in 1850 on the banks of the Cooper River, holds Confederate generals, plantation owners, and victims of the 1886 earthquake. Its Victorian monuments and moss-draped oaks create an atmosphere that attracted visitors even before ghost tours existed.

        <p>
          The churchyards of St. Philip's and St. Michael's, both downtown, contain 18th-century graves of Charleston's founding families. John C. Calhoun is buried at St. Philip's. These active churches offer daytime tours that combine architecture, history, and ghost lore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Circular Congregational Church's graveyard, the oldest English burial ground in Charleston, dates to 1681. Revolutionary War patriots, plague victims, and some of the city's earliest settlers rest in its crowded grounds.

          Charleston's pub crawl scene offers a different atmosphere than Savannah's, with drinks consumed at each stop rather than carried between bars. Poogan's Porch, a restaurant in a Victorian house, claims a ghost named Zoe who appears to diners and staff.
        </p>

          The Blind Tiger Pub takes its name from Prohibition-era speakeasies that displayed stuffed tigers to indicate illegal alcohol was available. The building dates to the 19th century and has its own reported hauntings.

          Tours typically last one hour and pass through the French Quarter, the Battery, and residential streets lined with antebellum mansions. The pace allows for detailed storytelling at each significant location.
