          Spanish explorers called it Cayo Hueso—Island of Bones—after finding human remains scattered across its beaches. Whether those bones belonged to Calusa burial sites or shipwreck victims has never been settled. The English corruption of that name gave us Key West, but the original meaning stuck. This is a place built on the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the 1830s, Key West was the wealthiest city per capita in the United States, its fortune built on salvaging wrecked ships from the treacherous Florida Reef. Over 100 vessels passed daily through waters where at least one ship per week ran aground. The wreckers who raced to these doomed ships made fortunes, but the sailors who died on the reef made Key West's reputation. More than 1,000 shipwrecks lie within Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yellow fever struck repeatedly throughout the 19th century, killing soldiers at Fort Jefferson and Fort East Martello and filling the Key West Cemetery with above-ground tombs. The island's isolation made it both a refuge and a trap—a place where pirates, smugglers, wreckers, and writers washed up and where the dead, by many accounts, never left.

      <div class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-4 border-l-2 border-purple-500/30 pl-8">
        <p>
          Key West's haunted reputation begins with geography. The island sits at the end of a 120-mile chain of limestone keys, surrounded by the most dangerous shipping lanes in the Western Hemisphere. The Florida Reef—the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States—runs parallel to the Keys, and its shallow, jagged formations have been destroying ships since the 1540s when Spanish treasure fleets began running gold and silver through the Straits of Florida.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wrecking industry that built Key West's wealth depended on death. Wreckers watched from 90-foot observation towers and raced to foundering ships, salvaging cargo while crews drowned. The federal wrecking court in Key West awarded salvors 25 to 50 percent of recovered goods. When the lighthouse at Key West was improved and the reef better charted, wreckers were accused of moving channel markers to cause the very wrecks they profited from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yellow fever epidemics swept through Key West in 1853, 1862, 1867, and periodically into the 1890s. Fort East Martello, built by the Union Army during the Civil War, doubled as a fever hospital where soldiers died faster from mosquito-borne disease than from any Confederate threat. The Key West Cemetery, established in 1847 after a hurricane washed coffins from the original burial ground, holds an estimated 100,000 burials on just 19 acres—more dead than the island's living population.

          The Florida Reef claimed ships with mechanical regularity. The Nuestra Senora de Atocha, a Spanish treasure galleon carrying gold, silver, emeralds, and indigo, sank in a 1622 hurricane off the Keys. Treasure hunter Mel Fisher spent 16 years searching before finding her in 1985—a $450 million haul that remains the most valuable maritime salvage in American history.

          The Isaac Allerton, wrecked in 1856, produced the richest salvage payout in Key West's wrecking court history. The San Pedro, part of the 1733 Spanish treasure fleet, sank in 18 feet of water carrying 16,000 pesos in Mexican silver and crates of Chinese porcelain. These ships and their crews are the foundation of Key West's ghost stories—drowned sailors, lost passengers, and the wreckers who profited from their misfortune.

          Robert the Doll is Key West's most famous resident—and he isn't alive. Created around 1904 by the Steiff Company in Germany, the straw-filled doll in a sailor suit was given to Robert Eugene Otto, a boy from a prominent Key West family who lived at 534 Eaton Street. What happened next has made Robert the most documented "haunted" object in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neighbors reported seeing the doll move in the windows of the Otto house. Servants claimed Robert changed expressions. The young Otto boy blamed household disturbances on the doll, and his parents found furniture overturned in rooms where only Robert had been left. When Otto grew up and became an artist, he kept Robert in the turret room of the family home, where visiting plumbers and electricians refused to work alone.

          After Otto's death in 1974, the doll was discovered in the attic by the home's new owners. In 1994, Robert was moved to the Fort East Martello Museum, where he sits in a glass case surrounded by letters of apology from visitors who disrespected him and later reported strings of bad luck—lost luggage, car accidents, job losses. The museum receives thousands of these letters. Visitors are advised to ask Robert's permission before photographing him.

          The Key West Cemetery was established in 1847 after a hurricane dislodged coffins from the island's original burial ground near the waterfront and washed them into the streets. The new cemetery, set on the island's highest ground at Solares Hill, spans 19 acres and holds an estimated 100,000 burials—far more dead than Key West's current population of roughly 25,000 living residents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above-ground vaults dominate the cemetery, a practical response to the island's high water table and coral rock foundation that made traditional burial nearly impossible. Sections are divided by heritage—Cuban, Bahamian, Catholic, Jewish, military—reflecting the waves of immigration that shaped Key West. One gravestone famously reads "I Told You I Was Sick."

          Yellow fever killed indiscriminately across the Keys throughout the 1800s. Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas operated a quarantine hospital where infected soldiers and prisoners were isolated—and frequently died. A submerged island near the fort still holds the remains of a 19th-century cemetery, its headstones discovered by divers in 2022. The most commonly reported ghost in the Key West Cemetery is said to be a Bahamian woman who confronts visitors who sit on graves or behave disrespectfully.

          Captain Tony's Saloon at 428 Greene Street has been, in succession, an ice house, the city morgue, a wireless telegraph station, a cigar factory, a speakeasy, a bordello, and the original location of Sloppy Joe's Bar before Hemingway's favorite watering hole moved down the block. During a renovation, workers discovered skeletal remains beneath the floor—consistent with its years as the morgue. A tree growing through the roof is said to have been the site of 17 hangings during Key West's pirate era.

          The Artist House at 534 Eaton Street—Robert the Doll's original home—is now a bed-and-breakfast where guests in the turret room have reported hearing footsteps, children's laughter, and objects moving on their own. The East Martello Fort, built in 1862 and never completed, houses not only Robert but also the remains of Elena Milagro de Hoyos, a young woman whose body was taken from a mausoleum by Carl von Cosel, a radiology technician obsessed with her, who kept her preserved corpse in his home for seven years.
