          Cursed Tours provides independent research on ghost tours across America's most haunted cities. We're not a tour operator—we don't sell tickets or take commissions. Our mission is to help travelers understand the historical context behind ghost tours so they can choose experiences that match their interests.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Every city we cover has a unique haunted history shaped by its founding, tragedies, and cultural traditions. We research the historical records behind each ghost story, distinguishing between documented events and legends that developed later. Both have value, but knowing the difference enhances understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          We examine primary sources when possible: court records, newspaper accounts, death certificates, and archival documents. When stories lack documentation, we say so. When historians dispute popular narratives, we present the debate.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">What We Cover</h2>
        <p>
          Our city guides explore the historical foundations of ghost tourism in each destination. We explain why certain locations became associated with hauntings, what actually happened there (when documented), and how those events shaped current tour offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our experience guides help readers understand different tour formats—walking tours, pub crawls, cemetery visits, paranormal investigations—so they can choose approaches that match their interests and comfort levels.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Editorial Independence</h2>
        <p>
          We maintain editorial independence from tour operators. Our content is not influenced by advertising relationships or affiliate partnerships. When we discuss specific tour companies, our assessments are based on publicly available information and historical accuracy, not promotional arrangements.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">For Skeptics and Believers</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you believe in ghosts or approach these tours as historical entertainment, our guides provide value. Skeptics appreciate documented history presented accurately. Believers appreciate context that enriches supernatural narratives. Everyone benefits from understanding what actually happened at the locations they visit.
