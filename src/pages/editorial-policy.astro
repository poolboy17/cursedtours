        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Research Standards</h2>
        <p>
          We prioritize primary sources: court records, contemporary newspaper accounts, official documents, and academic research. When primary sources are unavailable, we rely on reputable secondary sources and clearly indicate the level of documentation available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ghost stories often evolve over time, with details added, changed, or sensationalized. We trace stories to their earliest documented appearances when possible and note how narratives have changed.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Distinguishing Fact from Legend</h2>
        <p>
          We clearly distinguish between documented historical events and legends that lack archival support. Both have value in understanding ghost tour culture, but readers deserve to know the difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          When historians dispute popular narratives, we present the scholarly consensus while acknowledging that tour guides may tell different versions. Our goal is accuracy, not debunking—but accuracy requires acknowledging when beloved stories lack documentation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Independence</h2>
        <p>
          Cursed Tours maintains editorial independence from tour operators, tourism boards, and hospitality businesses. We do not accept payment for coverage, reviews, or recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we mention specific tour companies or locations, our assessments are based on publicly available information, historical accuracy of their presentations, and documented reputation—not commercial relationships.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Corrections</h2>
        <p>
          We take factual accuracy seriously. If you identify an error in our content, please contact us with documentation. We will review the evidence and update our content when warranted, noting significant corrections.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Sensitive Content</h2>
        <p>
          Ghost tours often involve tragic history: slavery, epidemics, violence, and death. We approach these subjects with appropriate gravity, recognizing that entertainment shouldn't minimize suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
          We name victims when documentation allows, acknowledge when tourism may conflict with descendant communities' wishes, and encourage readers to consider the ethical dimensions of dark tourism.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Paranormal Claims</h2>
        <p>
          We neither endorse nor dismiss paranormal claims. Our focus is historical documentation, not metaphysical debates. When tours make supernatural claims, we report them as part of the tour experience without asserting their validity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Readers seeking paranormal experiences and skeptics seeking historical accuracy can both find value in our content. We respect both perspectives while maintaining focus on verifiable information.
