The Georgetown steps and the house on Prospect Street became horror landmarks after director William Friedkin's 1973 film adaptation — and the neighborhood has never quite recovered.</p>\n\n<p>This article is part of our <a href=\"/washington-dc-ghost-tours/\">comprehensive Washington DC ghost tours guide</a>. Whether you're planning a visit or researching from afar, these stories reveal a side of Washington DC most visitors never see.</p>\n\n<h2>Origins: The 1949 Exorcism That Sparked a Legend</h2> <p>Can a single, messy case file and a handful of eyewitness statements travel across decades to become a cultural obsession? The story usually traced back to William Peter Blatty’s 1971 novel begins with a 1949 exorcism in the St. Louis area involving a thirteen-year-old boy given the pseudonym \"Roland Doe\" or \"Robbie Mannheim.\" The case attracted the attention of Jesuit priests, most notably Father William S. Bowdern and Father Walter H. Halloran, who have been named repeatedly in historical accounts and later interviews. Those priests, and the official letters and hospital notes that survive, form the factual spine behind the myth.</p> <p>Contemporaneous paperwork at the time is thin, but several credible documents and firsthand statements exist. Father Walter H. Halloran provided later affidavits and interviews in which he described inexplicable noises, scratches appearing on the boy's skin, and violent behavior during the Catholic rites. Father William S. Bowdern’s involvement is documented in correspondence archived at Saint Louis University. The medical and parish records that can be located show the family sought medical and psychological help before the Church intervened, a pattern that matters to anyone trying to separate documented events from the supernatural framing that followed.</p> <p>What is clear is that the St. Louis case was unusual in 1949 because it involved multiple clergy, repeated liturgical rites, and enough anecdotal intensity to attract media attention. Over the decades that followed, those raw incidents—medical consultations, odd behaviors, and the priests’ own accounts—were reworked into a narrative that could be dramatized. That dramatic retelling is precisely what William Peter Blatty would take and reframe for his novel, transferring setting and character to make a story that felt both intimate and ominously American.</p><h2>Blatty, the Novel, and the Move to Georgetown</h2> <p>Why did a St. Louis case end up set in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.? William Peter Blatty, a Georgetown University alumnus who earned his degree in 1950, reshaped the material with deliberate choices that heightened atmosphere and social contrast. His 1971 novel, The Exorcist, kept the kernel of the 1949 St. Louis case—the alleged possession, the participation of Jesuit priests like Father Bowdern, and the fundamental question of faith—but moved the action to a leafy, affluent Georgetown neighborhood that readers would recognize as a locus of political power and secular modernity. The novel’s Georgetown setting allowed Blatty to juxtapose the Catholic ritual with urban liberal life, increasing the story’s cultural friction. For related history, see our <a href=\"/articles/arlington-cemetery-ghost-stories-dc/\">arlington cemetery</a>.</p> <p>The book’s publication in 1971 and its runaway success set the stage for the 1973 film directed by William Friedkin. Friedkin kept Blatty’s Georgetown setting and made deliberate choices about location that would give the film a chilling realism: the MacNeil residence exterior, the steep public steps, the hospital corridors—these visual anchors helped translate the novel’s dread into cinematic terms. Blatty’s own conversations with priests who had been involved in the 1949 affair supplied him with the kinds of particulars that sell as authenticity: reported objects moving, unusual noises, and priests exhausted by repeated rites.</p> <p>Blatty never pretended to be a historian; he was a novelist and a screenwriter who used real events as an inspiration. That literary license is part of the reason the story migrated from midwestern parish records to the national imagination centered in Georgetown. The result was a feedback loop: the book and film created a set of public images (the house, the steps, the child’s room) that then shaped later local folklore and “Georgetown ghost” narratives, even if the original, verifiable events had occurred elsewhere.</p><h2>The Georgetown House and the Exorcist Steps: Locations and Addresses</h2> <p>The film’s most persistent physical markers are the house used for exterior shots and the public stairway often called the \"Exorcist Steps.\" The house exterior that audiences associate with Regan MacNeil’s home is located in Georgetown at 3600 Prospect Street NW (the precise number has been given variously in tour literature; visitors will find the recognizable façade used in key shots). The famous stairway used in the film, where Father Karras falls, sits a few blocks away at the steep public steps near 36th and Prospect Street NW—this exact topography has become part of the pilgrimage route for film fans and those interested in haunted history.</p> <p>Those two precise locations—3600 Prospect Street NW for the house exterior and the steps at 36th & Prospect for the staircase—anchor the cinematic geography of The Exorcist in Georgetown. They also anchor the local folklore: the combination of an ominous housefront and a dramatic public stairway is visual shorthand for \"Georgetown haunted.\" As a result, these spots appear on maps, on tour itineraries, and in many souvenir photos. For related history, see our <a href=\"/articles/capitol-building-dc-haunted-history/\">the u.s. capitol building</a>.</p> <p>Because these locations are private residences or active public places, there are practical considerations: people often photograph the façade from the public sidewalk and treat the steps as public urban landscape, but respect for neighbors and safety on the steep stairs is important. The places have become a focus for those searching for a \"Georgetown ghost\" experience, yet most of the site-specific stories involve atmospheric sensations, cold drafts and a felt sense of history rather than verifiable phenomena tied to a single object or room.</p><h2>Reported Paranormal Experiences: Witnesses and Testimonies</h2> <p>Distinguishing witness testimony from rumor is central to any responsible account. The most cited firsthand testimony connected to the 1949 St. Louis origin case comes from Father Walter H. Halloran, who participated in multiple exorcism rites between January and April 1949 and later discussed his involvement in detail. Halloran’s accounts—given in interviews and an affidavit—describe nights of loud banging, furniture movement, scratches appearing spontaneously, and violent behaviors by the subject that were outside documented prior patterns. Father William S. Bowdern, also involved, left correspondence and parish records that corroborate a sustained clerical response and the involvement of multiple priests.</p> <p>On the film side, several principal participants have spoken of being unnerved during production without claiming supernatural contact. Ellen Burstyn, who played Chris MacNeil, has described the role as emotionally and spiritually draining; she has recounted how intense the experience felt and how the material affected her sleep and mood during production. William Friedkin, the director, has told journalists that filming certain scenes produced a persistent atmosphere of unease for cast and crew. Those statements are not the same as eyewitness claims of poltergeist activity, but they are specific testimonies about the psychological impact and atmosphere around the production.</p> <p>Local reports in Georgetown tend to be less formal but consistent in type: tourists and neighbors often report cold spots on the stairway, a sensation of being watched near the house façade, and occasional complaints of unexplained lights or camera malfunction during evening visits. Those contemporary reports rarely come with verifiable physical evidence, but they have been collected by local historians and tour operators and have fed the broader reputation of the site. Taken together, the documented priestly testimonies from 1949 and the later statements by film participants form two separate threads of witness testimony—one tied to a mid-century pastoral crisis, the other tied to the cultural production that popularized the story.

Research and Skepticism</h2> <p>Responsible interpretation requires parsing what can be verified from what has been amplified. Researchers such as Mark Opsasnick have examined the archival record and newspaper reportage and shown how several elements of the story were embellished or relocated. The verified facts are straightforward: an exorcism case did occur in 1949 in the St. Louis area; Jesuit priests including Father Bowdern and Father Halloran were involved; William Peter Blatty used that case as the inspiration for a novel set in Georgetown. Beyond that, many of the more sensational details—full-body levitation on camera, unambiguous photographic evidence, or multiple independent, contemporaneous civilian witnesses reporting paranormal objects moving—remain unconfirmed.</p> <p>To make that clearer, the following simple table lays out core elements and their evidentiary status:</p> <table> <tr><th>Element</th><th>Verifiable Fact</th><th>Degree of Confirmation</th></tr> <tr><td>1949 exorcism involving \"Roland Doe\"</td><td>Documented in parish correspondence and later priest statements</td><td>High</td></tr> <tr><td>Priests William S. Bowdern and Walter H. Halloran</td><td>Named participants with archival traces and interviews</td><td>High</td></tr> <tr><td>Blatty’s novel set in Georgetown</td><td>Published 1971; explicit transposition by author</td><td>High</td></tr> <tr><td>Exterior shots filmed at Georgetown house and steps</td><td>Film records and on-site comparison confirm locations</td><td>High</td></tr> <tr><td>Extensive, contemporaneous public evidence of supernatural phenomena</td><td>Mostly anecdotal, lacking reproducible documentation</td><td>Low</td></tr> </table> <p>Scholars and skeptics point out that cultural storytelling practices—novelization, cinematic spectacle, and local tourism—naturally amplify certain images and narratives. The move from St. Louis to Georgetown was a literary choice, not a claim of a new haunting. That amplification does not negate human experiences of fear or the emotional truth of witnesses, but it does mean that a critical reader should treat spectacular claims with caution and look to the archival and testimonial record for anchors.</p> <h2>Visiting Today: Tours, Etiquette, and What People Report</h2> <p>What should someone expect when they go looking for the \"Georgetown Exorcist House\"? Practically speaking, the house exterior at 3600 Prospect Street NW is a private residence, and the steps at 36th & Prospect are a public city staircase. Many visitors come armed with cameras and a knowledge of the film’s iconic images. Guides and local histories emphasize respectful behavior: no trespassing on private property, no loud or disruptive conduct on the steps, and sensitivity to residents who live in the area. This practical etiquette is part of how the local community balances historical interest with daily life.</p> <p>Accounts collected by tour operators and neighborhood historians typically describe subtle, atmospheric experiences rather than overt poltergeist manifestation: an unexpected chill on the steps, the audible echo of footsteps when no one is nearby, or the sense that the place carries cinematic memory. Those reports are the ones most often cited in “Georgetown ghost” and “Georgetown haunted” listings. Visitors should understand that the weight of the landmark is cultural as much as supernatural—the images from a best-selling book and a landmark film have been grafted onto a real urban landscape.</p> <p>Practical tips offered by local historians and responsible tour operators include visiting by day to compare film frames to the existing architecture, using public transit or lawful parking, and reading primary-source accounts (such as the statements of Father Halloran) to put folklore in context. For those interested in haunted history from a critical perspective, the site supports both imaginative engagement—photography, careful storytelling—and a record-based approach that respects both the original witnesses and the living neighborhood. In short, the Georgetown Exorcist House is a place where cinematic legend, archived testimony and local memory meet; how a visitor experiences it will depend on whether one privileges narrative, evidence, or personal sensation.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Continue Reading</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/most-haunted-places-in-washington-dc/\">Most Haunted Places in Washington DC: Power, Death, and Ghosts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/white-house-ghost-stories-lincoln/\">White House Ghost Stories: Lincoln's Spirit and the Haunted Presidency</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/capitol-building-dc-haunted-history/\">The U.S. Capitol Building: Ghosts in the Halls of Power</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/washington-dc-ghost-tours/\">Washington DC Ghost Tours — Complete Guide</a></li>\n\n<li><a href=\"/articles/arlington-cemetery-ghost-stories-dc/\">Arlington Cemetery: Ghost Stories from America's Most Sacred Ground</a></li>\n</ul>",
