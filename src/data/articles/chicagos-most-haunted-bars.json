  "content": "Chicago's bar culture predates Prohibition, survived Prohibition, and emerged from Prohibition with a collection of ghost stories that rival the city's official haunted landmarks. The oldest taverns in the city have been accumulating reports of unusual phenomena for generations—unexplained sounds, moving objects, spectral figures, and the pervasive sense that the after-hours crowd includes patrons who never left.\n\n<a href=\"/chicago-ghost-tours/\">Haunted pub crawls</a> through Chicago combine the city's legendary drinking culture with its supernatural reputation. The best stops are not themed tourist bars but genuine working taverns where the hauntings are incidental to the business—places where the bartender might mention the ghost the same way they'd mention the daily special.\n\n\n\n<h2>The Green Mill Cocktail Lounge</h2>\nThe Green Mill at 4802 North Broadway in Uptown is Chicago's most famous bar, and its history is inseparable from the city's gangster era. Originally opened in 1907 as Pop Morse's Roadhouse, it was renamed the Green Mill Gardens in 1910 and quickly became one of the city's premier entertainment venues.Al Capone claimed a regular booth near the back of the house—positioned, characteristically, near a rear exit that connected to the basement tunnels. These tunnels, used for bootlegging during Prohibition, extend beneath the building and into the surrounding neighborhood. Capone's associate Jack McGurn controlled the operations and operations of the Green Mill. The bar's star attraction was crooner Joe E. Lewis, who was paid an extraordinary $650 per week to perform—an enormous sum during the 1920s. When Lewis signed to perform at a rival mob-controlled establishment, McGurn's men attacked him on November 27, 1927. They beat Lewis and slashed his throat so severely that his tongue was partially severed, nearly destroying his ability to sing. Lewis miraculously survived and eventually recovered enough to transition to a successful comedy career, but the incident served as a stark warning about mob control and disloyalty.\n\nThe Green Mill still operates as a jazz club, its original 1920s interior largely intact. Staff report regular unexplained phenomena: glasses that slide across the bar without being touched, items in the basement tunnels moving on their own, cold drafts emanating from the tunnel entrances, the sound of piano music heard from outside the building that stops abruptly when staff members enter, the sound of voices from the basement when no one is below, and a persistent feeling of being observed in the booth once reserved for Capone. Psychic investigators have identified multiple resident spirits: a woman who reportedly prefers to sit on or near the piano, a former employee, and a flirtatious former regular who seems to make grand entrances through the front door as if hoping to be noticed.\n\nThe bar's atmosphere—dim lighting, live jazz, original woodwork—makes it difficult to separate genuine phenomena from the natural effects of an old building with a famous history. This ambiguity is part of the Green Mill's appeal: it is a place where the past is so palpable that the boundary between historical atmosphere and supernatural presence becomes impossible to define.\n\n\n\n<h2>Excalibur</h2>The building at 632 North Dearborn Street was constructed in 1892 as the headquarters of the Chicago Historical Society, nearly two decades after the Great Fire of 1871. Designed as a Romanesque stone fortress, it has survived the years and has housed various businesses since the Chicago Historical Society relocated, most notably the Excalibur nightclub. The building's stone construction and pre-fire foundations extend below modern street level, creating basement spaces that feel significantly older than the visible structure. Some architectural elements predate 1871, suggesting reuse of surviving stonework from the Fire era.\n\nParanormal reports at Excalibur span decades and multiple incarnations of the business. Staff and patrons have described apparitions on the upper floors, objects moving without explanation, and anomalous readings on electromagnetic detection equipment. The dome room on the third floor generates particularly consistent reports of a female figure who appears briefly and vanishes.\n\nMultiple paranormal investigation teams have conducted formal investigations at Excalibur, reporting findings that include Electronic Voice Phenomena, temperature anomalies, and photographic evidence that they consider significant. The building's stone construction and multi-level layout create an environment that investigators describe as unusually active.\n\n<h2>The Red Lion Pub</h2>\n\nThe Red Lion Pub at 2446 North Lincoln Avenue presents an unusual case in Chicago's haunted bar landscape. Unlike the Green Mill or Excalibur, the Red Lion does not have a documented long history preceding its haunted reputation. The pub was opened in 1984 by British expatriate John Cordwell in a nondescript building that had previously housed various commercial businesses with no notable historical records. The structure itself appears to be from the late 19th or early 20th century, but its origins and previous uses are poorly documented.\n\nAlmost immediately after opening, staff and patrons began reporting phenomena: objects moving on their own, unexplained sounds and voices, a persistent presence on the second floor, and a general atmosphere of unease that intensified after closing time. Cordwell himself reportedly experienced phenomena and came to believe the building was genuinely haunted, though he was never able to identify a specific historical cause—no murder, disaster, or violent death has been documented in the building's history. This makes the Red Lion's case unique: proof that a haunting does not require a dramatic origin story.\n\nThe Red Lion's case is interesting because it challenges the assumption that hauntings require a dramatic origin story. The building has no documented history of murder, disaster, or violent death. Yet the reports have been consistent across forty years of operation, from staff members with no incentive to invent stories that might discourage customers.\n\n\n\n<h2>Liar's Club</h2>\n\nLiar's Club at 1665 West Fullerton has been a Bucktown dive bar for decades. Its reputation for hauntings is quieter than the more famous establishments but no less persistent among staff. Bartenders and regulars report cold spots that appear and disappear without pattern, the sound of footsteps on the upper floors when no one is present, and an occasional spectral figure seen in the mirror behind the bar.\n\nThe building's history includes use as a residential dwelling, a commercial establishment, and—during Prohibition—possibly as a speakeasy, though documentation is thin. The hauntings, such as they are, fit the profile of many Chicago bar ghosts: subtle, consistent, and accepted by staff as part of the building's character rather than as a source of alarm.\n\n<h2>The Old Town Ale House</h2>\n\nThe Old Town Ale House at 219 West North Avenue, adjacent to Second City, is one of Chicago's most beloved dive bars and has been a neighborhood fixture since the 1950s. The walls are lined with paintings by owner Bruce Cameron Elliott, including nudes and caricatures of local politicians and celebrities—a unique form of visual commentary on Chicago's cultural landscape. The Ale House attracts a mix of comedians, writers, neighborhood regulars, and tourists seeking authentic Chicago atmosphere.\n\nReports of unusual phenomena at the Ale House are sporadic but memorable. Staff have described hearing conversations and laughter from empty sections of the bar, feeling taps on the shoulder when no one is standing behind them, seeing brief shadowy apparitions near the back of the establishment, and experiencing cold spots that appear and disappear without pattern. The bar's late-night hours, atmospheric lighting, and storied history as a gathering place for Chicago's creative community contribute to an environment where the line between ordinary and extraordinary is pleasantly blurred. Some suggest the phenomena may be benign residual presences of departed patrons who found the Ale House too welcoming to abandon.\n\n<h2>Drinking with the Dead</h2>Chicago's haunted bars share a common quality: they are places where the living and the dead (allegedly) coexist without much fuss. The ghosts, if present, are not dramatic or threatening. They are residual presences—remnants of previous occupants or patrons who apparently found the atmosphere agreeable enough to remain.\n\nFor visitors to <a href=\"/articles/most-haunted-places-in-chicago/\">Chicago's haunted landmarks</a>, the city's bars offer an accessible and enjoyable entry point. You don't need to walk through a dark forest or visit a cemetery to encounter Chicago's supernatural side.
