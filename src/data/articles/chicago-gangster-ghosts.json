  "content": "Between 1920 and 1933, Prohibition transformed Chicago into a war zone. Over 700 gangland murders occurred in the city during this period, most of them never solved. The violence was driven by the economics of illegal alcohol: an industry worth an estimated $100 million annually controlled by competing criminal organizations willing to kill for market share.\n\nThe era produced some of America's most infamous criminals—Al Capone, Bugs Moran, Dean O'Banion, and John Dillinger among them. It also produced ghosts. The sites of Prohibition-era violence remain <a href=\"/articles/most-haunted-places-in-chicago/\">among Chicago's most actively haunted locations</a>, generating reports that have persisted for nearly a century after the gunfire stopped.\n\n\n\n<h2>The St. Valentine's Day Massacre</h2>\nOn February 14, 1929, seven men associated with George \"Bugs\" Moran's North Side Gang were lined against a wall inside the SMC Cartage Company garage at 2122 North Clark Street and shot by gunmen dressed as police officers. The massacre was widely attributed to Al Capone's organization, though Capone was in Florida at the time and no one was ever convicted of the killings. Most historians believe <strong>James Vincent \"Machine Gun Jack\" McGurn</strong> (1905–1936), Capone's most trusted enforcer and lieutenant, orchestrated the execution as part of Capone's campaign to consolidate control over Chicago's bootlegging operations. The victims—Pete Gusenberg, Frank Gusenberg, Albert Kachellek (alias James Clark), Adam Heyer, Reinhart Schwimmer, Albert Weinshank, and John May—were killed with Thompson submachine guns and shotguns. Frank Gusenberg survived the initial shooting and was found alive by real police officers. When asked who shot him, he reportedly replied: \"Nobody shot me.\" He died three hours later at a hospital.\n\nThe garage was demolished in 1967, but not before the bullet-scarred wall was purchased by Canadian businessman George Patey. The bricks were sold individually to collectors and have been associated with reports of bad luck and supernatural phenomena by several owners—illnesses, financial ruin, divorces, and unexplained deaths. Some of the bricks, particularly those bearing blood stains or bullet holes, were especially feared as cursed. Eventually, 300 of the original bricks were relocated to the Las Vegas Mob Museum, where visitors report hearing the faint sound of gunshots and men moaning in the darkness. The site at 2122 North Clark Street is now a parking lot adjacent to a nursing home. Visitors and employees have reported hearing gunfire and screaming from the empty lot, particularly on or around February 14.\n\n\n\n<h2>The Biograph Theater</h2>John Dillinger was not a Prohibition gangster in the traditional sense—he robbed banks, not bootlegging operations—but his death in Chicago cemented the city's reputation for spectacular criminal violence. On July 22, 1934, FBI agents shot Dillinger outside the Biograph Theater on Lincoln Avenue after he emerged from a showing of the film Manhattan Melodrama.\n\nThe woman who identified Dillinger to the waiting agents, <strong>Ana Cumpănaș</strong> (1910–1936, a Romanian-born madam and Dillinger associate), was described in contemporary press reports as wearing a red dress. She was actually wearing an orange/yellow skirt—the red appearance was a photographic and perceptual artifact caused by the theater's bright marquee lights and the evening's warm color temperature. Nevertheless, she entered legend and popular culture as \"the Lady in Red,\" a nickname that obscured her actual identity and motivated Capone associates to murder her in 1936.\n\nDillinger fell in the alley adjacent to the theater. Bystanders reportedly dipped handkerchiefs and newspaper in his blood as souvenirs. The theater continues to operate as a venue, its original marquee still intact. Pedestrians have reported seeing a blue, translucent figure running into the alley and vanishing. The alley itself produces a persistent, localized chill that visitors describe as inconsistent with surrounding temperatures.\n\n<h2>Al Capone's Chicago</h2>\n<strong>Alphonse Gabriel \"Al\" Capone</strong> (1899–1947), a Brooklyn-born organized crime boss, controlled Chicago's bootlegging, gambling, and prostitution operations from the mid-1920s until his conviction for tax evasion in 1931. His criminal empire generated an estimated $100 million annually—equivalent to over $1.5 billion today—and extended throughout the Midwest. He maintained his primary headquarters at the Lexington Hotel at 22nd Street and Michigan Avenue, where he occupied several floors, maintained a private arsenal, and conducted business behind multiple layers of armed guards and business fronts.The Lexington Hotel was demolished in 1995, but during its final decades, employees and visitors reported phenomena consistent with a haunted location: unexplained sounds, cold spots, the sensation of being watched, and—most distinctively—the smell of cigar smoke in rooms where no one was smoking. Capone was famously attached to his cigars, and the olfactory element of these reports lends them a specificity unusual in haunted location claims.\n\nOther Capone-associated locations include the Congress Plaza Hotel on Michigan Avenue, where he maintained a suite. Room 441 in particular is considered one of the most haunted rooms in Chicago, with guests reporting the apparition of a man in 1920s clothing and unusual cold spots. The phantom is believed to be connected to a figure known as \"Peg Leg Jonny,\" a homeless man with a prosthetic leg who was murdered in the alley outside the Congress Plaza Hotel, likely by Capone associates. The precise date and circumstances of his death are undocumented, but his ghost is said to turn lights on and off throughout the building, manifest in sudden temperature changes, and move objects in the kitchen and service areas.\\n\\nThe Green Mill Cocktail Lounge in Uptown, where Capone held a reserved booth near the back exit (positioned for quick escape), still operates as a jazz club and retains its original 1920s interior, including the tunnels beneath the building used for bootlegging. The bar has embraced its gangster heritage, and staff report occasional unexplained occurrences—glasses moving, cold drafts from the tunnel entrances, and the sound of jazz music from the basement when no one is below. Some visitors claim to see the translucent figure of Capone himself seated in his old booth, nursing a cigar.\n\n\n\n<h2>Dean O'Banion's Flower Shop</h2>\n\nBefore Capone consolidated power, Chicago's bootlegging was controlled by several competing organizations. <strong>Dean Charles \"Dion\" O'Banion</strong> (1892–1924), leader of the North Side Gang, operated a flower shop at 738 North State Street—directly across from Holy Name Cathedral. The shop served as both a legitimate business (O'Banion was a genuinely skilled florist known for creative arrangements) and a front for his bootlegging and gambling operations.\n\nOn November 10, 1924, three men entered O'Banion's flower shop, ostensibly to pick up a flower arrangement for a funeral. One man shook O'Banion's hand and held it while the other two shot him six times at close range. The murder was ordered by <strong>Johnny Torrio</strong> (Capone's predecessor and mentor) and carried out by <strong>Frankie Yale</strong> and associates. This assassination launched a series of retaliatory gang wars that would reshape Chicago's criminal underworld and culminate in the Valentine's Day Massacre five years later.\n\nThe flower shop location has housed various businesses since, and Holy Name Cathedral across the street still bears bullet scars from a related shooting—the September 20, 1926 assassination of O'Banion's successor, <strong>Earl \"Hymie\" Weiss</strong> (1898–1926), on the cathedral steps. Weiss was gunned down by Capone associates while walking from his apartment to the church for prayer, a killing that escalated the North Side-South Side gang war to unprecedented levels. Visitors to the area report a persistent sense of unease, and some have described seeing a figure arranging flowers in the window of the building that was once O'Banion's shop.\n\n<h2>Paranormal Echoes: The Dog Survivor</h2>\n\nOne curious detail from the Valentine's Day Massacre has entered paranormal folklore: a dog was present in the garage during the shooting and was the only living creature to survive the massacre. This animal apparently left behind a psychic imprint so powerful that dogs passing near the original Clark Street site for decades afterward would become anxious and agitated, despite having no rational reason for distress. Handlers described their dogs refusing to approach the fence, whimpering, and pulling away with unusual intensity. Whether this phenomenon represents genuine supernatural residue or simply canine sensitivity to accumulated trauma embedded in the location remains debated among paranormal investigators and skeptics alike.\n\n<h2>The Geography of Violence</h2>\n\nWhat distinguishes Chicago's gangster ghosts from its other hauntings is the personal nature of the violence. The <a href=\"/articles/great-chicago-fire-ghosts/\">Great Fire</a> and the <a href=\"/articles/eastland-disaster-chicago/\">Eastland Disaster</a> were impersonal catastrophes. The gangster killings were targeted murders—individuals killed by name, for specific reasons, in specific places.\n\n<a href=\"/chicago-ghost-tours/\">Ghost tours</a> that focus on Chicago's gangster era navigate a landscape where the violence was intimate and the locations are precisely known. The garage where seven men were executed. The alley where Dillinger fell. The flower shop where O'Banion was gunned down over a handshake. These are not abstract historical events but crimes committed at identifiable street addresses, by identifiable perpetrators, against identifiable victims.\n\nThe ghosts, if they exist, are equally specific. They are not anonymous specters but individuals—a running figure in a familiar alley, cigar smoke in an empty room, the sound of gunfire on a February night from a lot where a garage once stood.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Continue Reading</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/most-haunted-places-in-chicago/\">Chicago's Most Haunted Places</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/hh-holmes-murder-castle-chicago/\">H.H.
