  "content": "<p>By the 1830s, Key West was the wealthiest city per capita in the United States. The source of that wealth was other people's catastrophe. Over 100 ships passed daily through the most dangerous waters in the Western Hemisphere, and at least one wrecked every week.</p>\n\n<p>This article is part of our <a href=\"/key-west-ghost-tours/\">comprehensive Key West ghost tours guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>The Florida Reef</h2>\n<p>The Florida Reef is the only living coral barrier reef in the continental United States, stretching roughly 170 miles from Miami to the Dry Tortugas. It runs parallel to the Florida Keys, and its shallow, jagged formations have been destroying ships since the 1540s, when Spanish treasure fleets began running gold and silver through the Straits of Florida. The reef sits in the path of the Gulf Stream, one of the strongest ocean currents in the world, which pushed sailing ships toward the coral at speeds they could not always counteract.</p>\n<p>More than 1,000 shipwrecks lie within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The reef claimed galleons, merchant ships, warships, and slavers with roughly equal indifference. The human cost—drowned sailors, lost passengers, crew killed by exposure on the reef before rescue arrived—is incalculable.</p>\n\n<h2>The Wrecking Industry</h2>\n<p>Key West's wreckers watched the reef from observation towers as tall as 90 feet and patrolled in their own small vessels. When a ship ran aground, the cry of \"Wreck Ashore\" echoed across the island. Men raced to the docks, and the first captain to reach the stricken vessel became the wrecking master, directing the salvage operation.</p>\n<p>Salvaged goods were auctioned in Key West's federal wrecking court, with salvors receiving 25 to 50 percent of the recovered value. The system made fortunes. Captain John Geiger, whose Audubon House still stands on Whitehead Street, was among the wealthiest wreckers. When lighthouses were improved and the reef better charted in the mid-1800s, wreckers were accused—with some justification—of moving channel markers to cause the very wrecks they profited from. The federal court issued its last wrecking license in 1921.</p>\n\n<h2>Famous Wrecks</h2>\n<p>The Nuestra Senora de Atocha, a Spanish treasure galleon carrying gold, silver, and emeralds, sank in a 1622 hurricane. Treasure hunter Mel Fisher spent 16 years searching before locating her in 1985, recovering an estimated $450 million in treasure. The Isaac Allerton, wrecked in 1856, produced the richest single salvage payout in Key West wrecking court history. The San Pedro, part of the 1733 Spanish treasure fleet, sank carrying 16,000 pesos in Mexican silver and crates of Chinese porcelain in just 18 feet of water south of Indian Key.</p>\n\n<h2>Ghost Ships and Drowned Sailors</h2>\n<p>Key West's earliest recorded ghost stories involve the sea. Sailors in the 1800s reported phantom lights over the reef and the sound of voices carried on the ocean breeze where no ships were present. The sheer concentration of violent death along the Florida Reef—thousands of sailors drowned over four centuries—provides the raw material for these stories. Fishermen still occasionally report lights near known wreck sites, and divers exploring the reef have described the unsettling experience of finding personal artifacts among the coral: buttons, belt buckles, and fragments of shoes.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Continue Reading</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/key-west-pirate-history-legends/\">Pirates of Key West: Wreckers, Smugglers, and Legends</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/captain-tonys-saloon-key-west-haunted/\">Captain Tony's Saloon: Key West's Most Haunted Bar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/most-haunted-places-in-key-west/\">Most Haunted Places in Key West</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/key-west-ghost-tours/\">Key West Ghost Tours — Complete Guide</a></li>\n</ul>",
