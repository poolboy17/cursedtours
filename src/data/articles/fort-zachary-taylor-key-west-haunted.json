  "content": "<p>Fort Zachary Taylor was built to be impregnable: five-foot-thick walls, a surrounding moat, and enough firepower to destroy any fleet. It saw action from the Civil War through the Cuban Missile Crisis. What it could not defend against were the ghosts its own soldiers reportedly left behind.</p>\n\n<p>This article is part of our <a href=\"/key-west-ghost-tours/\">comprehensive Key West ghost tours guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>A Century of Service</h2>\n<p>Construction of Fort Zachary Taylor began in 1845 on a man-made island off Key West's southwestern shore. Named for President Zachary Taylor, the fort was designed as a trapezoidal structure with three tiers of gun emplacements capable of mounting over 200 cannons. It was one of the most heavily armed forts in the nation.</p>\n<p>During the Civil War, Fort Taylor remained under Union control despite Florida's secession. Its strategic position allowed the Union to maintain a naval blockade of Confederate shipping in the Gulf of Mexico. The fort's garrison endured the same tropical diseases—yellow fever, malaria, dysentery—that plagued every military installation in the Keys. Soldiers died of illness in the fort's casemates and were buried in the growing Key West Cemetery.</p>\n<p>The fort remained active through the Spanish-American War, both World Wars, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, when it served as a staging area during the naval quarantine of Cuba. It was decommissioned and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973.</p>\n\n<h2>The Ammunition Discovery</h2>\n<p>In the 1960s, during excavation work, workers discovered the largest cache of Civil War-era ammunition ever found. Hundreds of cannons and thousands of rounds had been buried within the fort's walls during post-war modifications, essentially sealed inside the structure for a century. The discovery added to the fort's mystique and drew renewed historical attention to the site.</p>\n\n<h2>Paranormal Reports</h2>\n<p>Park rangers and visitors consistently report Fort Zachary Taylor as the most haunted fort on the island. Apparitions in Civil War-era uniforms have been seen in the casemates—the vaulted brick rooms that housed cannons and served as barracks. Cold spots are reported in interior corridors regardless of the tropical heat outside. Visitors describe hearing muffled commands, the clank of metal, and footsteps on stone floors in areas where no one else is present.</p>\n<p>The fort's thick walls and echoing chambers create natural acoustic effects that could account for some reports. But the consistency of the descriptions across decades—uniformed figures, military sounds, the sensation of being observed—keeps Fort Zachary Taylor on every Key West ghost tour itinerary.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Continue Reading</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/fort-east-martello-key-west-haunted/\">Fort East Martello: Key West's Haunted Civil War Fort</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/key-west-yellow-fever-fort-jefferson/\">Yellow Fever, Fort Jefferson, and the Dry Tortugas</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/most-haunted-places-in-key-west/\">Most Haunted Places in Key West</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/key-west-ghost-tours/\">Key West Ghost Tours — Complete Guide</a></li>\n</ul>",
