He receives more mail than most living residents of the island. The letters are apologies.</p>\n\n<p>This article is part of our <a href=\"/key-west-ghost-tours/\">comprehensive Key West ghost tours guide</a>. Whether you're planning a visit or researching from afar, these stories reveal a side of Key West most visitors never see.</p>\n\n<h2>The Otto Family and the Doll's Origins</h2>\n<p>In 1904, Robert Eugene Otto—called Gene by his family—was a young boy living in a Victorian home at 534 Eaton Street in Key West. He received a straw-filled doll dressed in a white sailor suit, manufactured by the Steiff Company in Germany. Gene gave the doll his first name, Robert, and kept it as a constant companion.</p>\n<p>The doll stands approximately 40 inches tall with button eyes and a slightly worn expression that visitors describe as unsettlingly lifelike. Two origin stories persist: one claims Gene's grandfather purchased the doll during a trip to Germany; the other, more dramatic version says a Bahamian servant gave it to the boy, possibly with the intent of placing a curse on the Otto household. Neither version has been conclusively verified.</p>\n<p>What is documented is that the Otto family's servants reported hearing Gene conversing with the doll in two distinct voices. Neighbors claimed to see the doll moving in windows. Furniture was found overturned in rooms where Gene and Robert had been left alone. When confronted, Gene's consistent response was: \"Robert did it.\"</p>\n\n<h2>Gene Otto's Adult Years</h2>\n<p>Gene Otto grew up to become an artist of some local reputation. He studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and in Paris before returning to Key West, where he lived in the family home on Eaton Street with his wife, Anne. Robert remained in the turret room on the second floor. Plumbers and electricians who worked in the house refused to be left alone with the doll. Anne reportedly despised Robert and wanted him removed, but Gene insisted he stay.</p>\n<p>Visitors to the home described an oppressive atmosphere in the turret room. Some reported that the doll's expression seemed to change. Gene kept Robert propped in a chair by the window, where passersby on Eaton Street claimed to see the doll shift positions when no one was in the room.</p>\n\n<h2>After Gene's Death</h2>\n<p>Gene Otto died in 1974. The house was purchased by William and Myrtle Reuter, who discovered Robert in the attic. Myrtle eventually moved to Von Phister Street, taking Robert with her. In 1994, she donated the doll to the Key West Art and Historical Society, reportedly telling them that Robert moved around her house on his own and was haunted.</p>\n<p>Since arriving at the Fort East Martello Museum, Robert has become the most visited exhibit. The museum, a Civil War-era brick fort at 3501 South Roosevelt Boulevard, displays Robert in a climate-controlled glass case surrounded by hundreds of letters from visitors who claim to have been cursed after showing disrespect.</p>\n\n<h2>The Apology Letters</h2>\n<p>The museum has catalogued over one thousand letters addressed directly to Robert. Visitors who photographed the doll without asking permission—a protocol posted on signs near the exhibit—write back describing strings of misfortune: lost luggage, car accidents, broken relationships, job losses, and medical emergencies. The letters range from brief notes to multi-page confessions, many including return postage for Robert's theoretical reply.</p>\n<p>Museum staff change the letters on display periodically but keep all of them archived. New letters arrive daily. Whether the letters reflect genuine supernatural experience or a self-reinforcing folklore tradition, they constitute one of the most unusual ongoing collections in any American museum.</p>\n\n<h2>Visiting Robert</h2>\n<p>Fort East Martello Museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission includes access to Robert's exhibit and the rest of the museum's collection, which covers Key West's military history and folk art. Visitors are advised to greet Robert, ask permission before photographing, and treat the doll with courtesy. Whether you believe the stories or not, the protocol has become part of the experience—and the walls of apology letters suggest that a surprising number of skeptics have reconsidered.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Continue Reading</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/most-haunted-places-in-key-west/\">Most Haunted Places in Key West: From Robert the Doll to the Cemetery</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/fort-east-martello-key-west-haunted/\">Fort East Martello: Key West's Haunted Civil War Fort</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/articles/carl-von-cosel-elena-hoyos-key-west/\">Carl von Cosel and Elena Hoyos: Key West's Most Disturbing True Story</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/key-west-ghost-tours/\">Key West Ghost Tours — Complete Guide</a></li>\n</ul>",
